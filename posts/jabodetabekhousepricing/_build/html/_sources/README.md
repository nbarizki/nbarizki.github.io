# Linear Regression Model of Jabodetabek House Price and its Implementation

The parametric form of linear regression gives an easier interpretation about significancy of its variables in determining the average of the response variable. However, simplistic model tends to have several limitations here and there. Especially for finding solutions using *least square* method, some of the assumptions shall be followed so that we can produce an accurate estimate.

## **What's Inside**

The nominal of house price, especially in Jabodetabek, is always an interesting topic to be discussed because it is continuosly  growing up in unusual trends. In this occasion, we will try to gain insight regarding Jabodetabek house price by utilizing information from the internet. The data itself will be retrieved from one of Indonesian house listing website, which will be explained in earlier part of this analysis.

Having the data explored in some ways to discover some valuable insight, we will begin developing linear model to have a reasonable basis to estimate Jabodetabek House Price based on several parameters regarding the characteristic of the house. Some assumption and statistical analysis will also be performed.

In later part of the analysis, I will demonstrate usefulness of the linear regression model by solving a simple fictitious problem to maximize profit of housing project. This activity involves optimization process by utilizing *Pyomo*, which is the *API* to instantiate *solver program* using python language.
